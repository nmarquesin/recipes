500g pack pork mince or British veal mince
200ml milk
2 x 400g cans chopped tomatoes
2 bay leaf
1 rosemary
 sprig
2 thyme
 sprigs
2 tsp dried oregano
2 beef stock cubes
500ml red wine
about 400g dried pasta
 sheets
50g Parmesan

Method

First infuse the milk for the béchamel sauce. Put the
 milk, onion, bay and cloves into a large saucepan 
 and bring very gently just up to the boil. Turn off 
 the heat and set aside for 1 hr to infuse.
For the meat sauce, put the oil, celery, onion, carrot, 
garlic and pancetta in another large saucepan. Gently 
cook together until the veg are soft but not coloured. 
Tip in all the mince, the milk and tomatoes. Using a 
wooden spoon, stir together and break up and mash the 
lumps of mince against the sides of the pan. When the 
mince is mostly broken down, stir in all the herbs, the 
stock cubes and wine, and bring to a simmer. Cover and 
cook for 1 hr, stirring occasionally to stop the bottom 
catching. Uncover and gently simmer for another 30 
mins-1 hr until the meat is tender and saucy. Taste and 
season.
To finish the béchamel, strain the milk through a fine 
sieve into one or two jugs. Melt the butter in the same 
pan then, using a wooden spoon, mix in the flour and 
cook for 2 mins. Stir in the strained milk, a little at 
a time – the mix will thicken at first to a doughy paste, 
but keep going, adding milk gradually to avoid lumps. 
When all the milk is in, bring to a gentle simmer, 
stirring constantly (if you have lumps, give it a quick 
whisk). Gently bubble for a few mins until thickened. 
Season with salt, pepper and nutmeg.
Heat oven to 180C/160C fan/gas 4. Spread a spoonful of 
the meat sauce over the base of a roughly 3.5 litre 
baking dish. Cover with a single layer of pasta sheets, 
snapping them to fit if needed, then top with a quarter 
of the béchamel. Spoon over a third of the meat sauce 
and scatter over a little Parmesan. Repeat the 
layers – pasta, béchamel, meat and Parmesan – two more 
times to use all the meat sauce. Add a final layer of 
pasta, the last of the béchamel and remaining Parmesan. 
Sit the dish on a baking tray to catch spills and bake 
for 1 hr until bubbling, browned and crisp on top.
